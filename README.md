# Multiple-Linear-Regression-House_pricing_estimation

This is the second lesson for machine learning, where I implemented a small set of housing data to test with Multiple Linear Regression. 

The housing data includes house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores nearby, longitude and latitude of the house. 

This simple test is a much better one compared to the bikesharing dataset as there were many classifications needed to be done in order to make a good fit for the model. Hence the R-2 score for the bikesharing model is very low.

This housing data however, uses multiple linear regression, and with each variable that I add, the R-2 score increases. It goes to show how much a variable can affect a model of the dataset and sometimes we simply cannot use only one variable to make a good fit.
